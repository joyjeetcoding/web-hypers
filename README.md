We have built a tourism website in a Hackathon conducted by Hack4Bengal 2022.


“Travel makes one modest, you see what a tiny place you occupy in the world.”: Is a famous quote by Gustave Flaubert.
Every people love travelling but visiting the same place over and over eventually becomes boring. Some places are overcrowded whereas some places are not known by the tourists.
The main problem we wish to solve is to help people know there are many places waiting for them to travel. It will also help boost the local tourism and the tourism revenue of a state can be increased.

I along with my team members(friends) as well as contributors KARAN GORAI and ANUP GORAI have made this website and I also want to thank them :)

Yeah, I know this is not the best but as 1st year students, we did what we knew and we have put our best efforts to look the website beautiful:)

Best is on the way :)
